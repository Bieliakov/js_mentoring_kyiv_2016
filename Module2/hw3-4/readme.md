> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.

## Running

The app is built with [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and compiled at runtime for a lighter and more fun code reading experience. As stated in the link, JSX is not mandatory.

1) run "npm install" command; *
2) spin up an HTTP server. For example, install globally module "node-static" with "npm i node-static -g" command;
3) run "static" command at the homework's root;
4) Open in a browser the following link http://127.0.0.1:8080 ;

*if you have some errors, then propably you should upgrade your npm. Easiest way to do that on Windows OS is through following the instructions at the following page https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-windows-upgrade
